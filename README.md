# Manuel Lera-Ram√≠rez's Personal Website

## Running the Site Locally

This is a simple static website built with HTML and Bootstrap. To run it locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser

If you use VSCode, you can install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to serve the site locally.

### Requirements
- A modern web browser
- No additional server or complex setup required

### Dependencies
The site uses:
- Bootstrap 5.3.2 (loaded via CDN)
- Font Awesome 6.4.2 (loaded via CDN)

Simply opening `index.html` will render the complete personal website with all styling and icons intact.
